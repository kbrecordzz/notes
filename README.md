# notes

Super simple note taking web "app" (= web site) for you who have your own web server with PHP on it.

HOW TO USE IT:
1. Have your own web server with PHP installed on it. If you have this I assume you know how to set up a website too. So, put index.php where you want it.
2. Create an empty file called "data.txt" in the same directory as index.php, and make it able to write to (in Linux: chmod 777 data.txt - very unsecure because it gives EVERYONE permission to do ANYTHING, but it works).
3. Set your own password in index.php ($password = "password").

LICENSE: kbrecordzz public domain license = use it however you want without needing to credit me (basically CC0 but much shorter legal text).
